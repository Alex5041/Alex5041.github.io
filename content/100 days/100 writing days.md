title: "100 writing days"
---

Previously I did 100 reading days, but looking back, I think It was mostly about
achieving consistency rather than improving pronunciation. Additionally, it is much easier than
writing, because it's consuming, not creating. This time, I'll try to write every day for 100 days,
following these rules:

1. Write on paper and scan it with Google Lens. Handwriting is more beneficial for improving
   writing ability.
2. Write at least 10 sentences and 300 words.
